<h3>Getting Them!</h3>
<p> The fox went to his den and found a stick. He grabbbed with his mouth and went back to the location of the grapes. He then jumped up and tried to hit the grapes with the stick but he could not reach them. He tried this 10 times and still never succeeded.     

<h3>Victory!</h3>
<p> He was becoming even more famished so he decided to climb and a tree and jump with the stick in this mouth. This was along shot . The fox got on the tree and it was victory and he devoured them feeling very accomplished. 

<h4>Aesop's Moral:</h4> <p>Continue trying $even if the going gets tough.
